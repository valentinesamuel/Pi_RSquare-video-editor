Feedback and questions are welcome!


**The live project can be found at [Video Editor](https://video-editor-pi.vercel.app/)**
## Tech/framework used
ReactJS
NanoID
Axios

## Problems Encountered
Anytime I called the **`/upload_file`** endpoint, it alwaays returned returned '400'. This made me unable to use the file path i was supposed to get from the request to perform other operations. However, I made the ui exactly as functional as the sample [give to me here](https://mythousandapp.herokuapp.com/)
